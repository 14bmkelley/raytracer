# Ray Tracer #

### About ###
This project is one that I did in my computing class last winter quarter in Python. I decided to try and rewrite in C. This is the result. Run the program with a list of spheres as input and it will create a 2D picture, complete with the affects of a light source and other details.

### Set Up: ###
To compile:
```
gcc *.c
```
To run:
```
./a.out <list of spheres>
```
